              Technocapitalism refers to changes in capitalism associated with
              the emergence of new technology sectors, the power of
              corporations, and new forms of organization. The problem is with
              technocapitalism, information is now controlled by a limited
              number of companies. And certainly there are very few companies
              that are participating in tech driven markets. All these is
              restricting competition.

The concept of innovative capacity provides a way to understand and measure fundamental aspects of technocapitalism.  Innovative capacity can be used at the level of activities, organizations and geographical areas.  It can also be used to understand the dynamics of technocapitalism or its major components.    

 <br>

<br>
Innovative capacity provides, first, a precise way to understand and measure invention and innovative potential.  Invention and innovation are fundamental to our understanding of technocapitalism.  They are directly related to all of the phenomena and effects considered in this website.

<br><br> 

  It is important to be able to measure as many aspects of invention and innovation as possible, to have more perspective on how technocapitalism came about, the roles of invention and innovation in it, and their dynamics.  Many of the existing tools in the social sciences are inadequate for this purpose.  Some of those tools were specifically created to measure aspects of industrial capitalism, and they are not well suited for understanding or measuring the phenomena of technocapitalism.

<br><br> 

Second, innovative capacity provides a multidimensional way to measure invention and innovative potential.  Innovative capacity is not tied to any sector, activity or industry.  It can therefore be used to measure invention and innovative potential in any activity where they are thought to be important.  It can also be used to compare the performance of various activities with one another. 

 <br><br>

Innovative capacity can be used to measure invention and innovative potential at the level of organizations.  Any organization for which invention and innovation is important can be analyzed.  Comparisons between organizations can also be performed.  This is particularly interesting in the case of experimentalist organizations, given their overarching emphasis on research, and their need to sustain continuous invention and innovation.  Comparisons between experimentalist organizations or firms in any given sector could, for example, provide insights on their importance in their respective fields,

and give an indication of benchmark performances.

 <br><br>

Measuring the geographical dimensions of invention and innovation is another possible use of innovative capacity.  It can be applied to nations, regions, urban areas or localities.  Any geographical area that is a source of invention and innovation can be analyzed through the innovative capacity framework.  Innovative capacity can also be used to make comparisons between geographical areas, to determine the dynamics of their technological leadership and performance.

 <br><br>

Innovative capacity can be used to measure the temporal dynamics of invention and innovative potential for any period of time.  This is particularly important for understanding the process of accumulation of inventions and its dynamics.  The dynamics of invention and innovation can therefore be analyzed for activities, sectors, industries, organizations and geographical areas.

              Continuous invention and innovation help reduce the risk and uncertainty surrounding new products.  Invention is possibly the riskiest of all economic activities.  Coming up with a new discovery often involves much trial and error, with no certainty over outcomes.  It is typically impossible to anticipate whether any new discovery will be successful as a product.  Many new products never recover the cost of their research, even when their technological qualities or advancement are substantial.        

 <br>
<br>
              The reduction of risk and uncertainty is particularly important for organizations facing regulatory hurdles.  In many biotechnology firms, for example, the rate of approval can be as low as one out of ten thousand new compounds.  Such low odds of success can only be offset by speeding up and turning out a continuous stream of new discoveries.  As a result, continuous invention and innovation have become an integral part of corporate strategy.
              
               <br>
              <br>
              Adding to the risk and uncertainty of invention is the fact that lead times between the introduction of a new product and the appearance of its closest competitor have substantially declined during the past two decades.  Therefore, even products that can be marketed with some success face the added challenge of one or more competitors within a very short period after their introduction.  This situation can cut the potential revenues of a new product substantially, forestalling the recovery of its research costs and its long-term profitability. 
              
               <br>
              <br>
              Continuous invention and innovation can help remedy this situation by making it possible to come up with new discoveries and introduce new products more frequently.  A possible result is a higher chance of more products finding no competitors in their market niches, even if for limited periods of time.  Thus, the main strengths provided by continuous invention and innovation lie in speed and numbers.  The larger the number of new discoveries being fielded in the market, and the faster it happens, the more likely it is that some of them will find no serious competitors over the short term. 
          <br>    
            <br>   
              
              Continuous invention and innovation is also necessary because of the increasing cost of research.  In many activities, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, bioinformatics or advanced microelectronics, laboratory equipment, facilities and other hardware costs are substantial and can only be recovered by speeding up the pace of invention and innovation, to turn out as many new products as possible.  Similarly, costs for research personnel can be substantial, given the high level of skills required.  For many firms, it is impossible to ignore the need to pursue continuous invention and innovation, and those that do so usually do not stay long in business.

               Everyone's talking about NFTs. NFT is an acronym for Non-Fungible Token. This marks the property that we hold on a unique object, not exchangeable for an object of the same type. NFTs are linked to a huge technological innovation: the blockchain. The blockchain is a database, created jointly by coders, open to all, tamper-proof and destined to last forever. NFTs therefore make it possible to create a title deed on an object and to register it in a block chain which guarantees its possession in the eyes of all and this, as long as the block chain is active. The incredible innovation of NFTs therefore lies in the fact of doing without a third party who would come to guarantee the transaction or membership.
                Now, if we accept that capitalism is a system of sharing value based on private property, then NFTs, by making private what could not be, will extend the influence of capitalism, will create new markets. NFT technology is on the way to becoming the new dominant part of capitalism, which demonstrates once again, its ability to transform itself and its environment through technology.

                    Often bought through cryptocurrency, which simply means a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. NFTs are created through Graphic Art, GIFS, videos and sports highlights, Music, Virtual Avatars, Designer Sneakers, and many more art collectibles.
                    NFTs are collectible items you have exclusive ownership of, and the buyer gets a digital file. Nowadays, depending on what NFT you bought, you can also receive a physical copy.  Some people think that investing in NFTs is uncertain and risky, but as a creator, NFT is great for creators/artists to expose and sell their art.

            <p>
              Networks are a very important element supporting the rise of technocapitalism.  Networks typically involve collaboration.  For invention and innovation, networks have become the means to collaboration, helping diffuse knowledge, reproduce creativity, and pull together the resources needed to undertake research.

 <br><br>

Networks have become easier than ever to establish and join.  The Internet, the Web and telecommunications have allowed the creation of networks for most every social and economic activity in existence today.  Helping this dynamic is the rapid decline in the cost of networking during the past four decades, which helped provide easier access on a global scale.

 <br><br>

The networked organization is typical of the emerging technocapitalist era.  Those organizations can be found in sectors that are most typical of technocapitalism, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, genomics, bioinformatics, software and biorobotics.  The survival of many firms in these sectors depends on their network relations for research.  As a result, for example, a proliferation of research unit-to-research unit (R2R) network linkages has occurred in recent times, to pursue collaborative projects and share research resources.  

 <br><br>

Some of this collaboration has led to networked alliances between organizations.  Such alliances are often broad-ranging and may involve not only research activities, but also production, marketing and service.  Research, however, is what usually pulls those alliances together, at least in the sectors and organizations that are typical of technocapitalism.  Networked research alliances often involve, for example, the co-ownership of patents derived from collaboration, joint use of laboratory equipment and facilities, and the sharing of revenues from discoveries.  Many of those alliances also help share the cost of research personnel and materials, thereby saving the participant organizations resources that can be redeployed to other activities.   

 <br><br>

Networks targeting research can also occur outside companies.  The most important example of this possibility is the Open Source movement for software design, which created the Linux software kernels.  This kind of networked research includes thousands of software programmers, working voluntarily in their spare time, with no compensation, to prepare code that will then be made available to anyone freely in the Web.  By making it available freely to anyone, they practically guarantee that the software will be used and then improved, as other software specialists expand and test the kernels, and correct flaws.  By placing subsequently improved versions in the Web, also available for free, it is assured that the process will continue and be compounded.  It may not come as a surprise, therefore, that the software developed through this kind of networked collaboration is often of higher quality than the one produced by software companies that prevent free access to their code, or that closely guard it as property.
